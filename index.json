In this class we will explore how web maps are designed and created, using the MapBox GL JS API.\nCourse Overview  what web maps are good for, and what they're less good for, what kinds of spatial data they use, how design considerations change for viewing spatial data online numerous interactive features, and how to do basic GIS online.

HTML  HyperText Markup Language  Files sent from servers to personal computers They tell the computer things like what to display or where to get data   HTML elements tell us things about where text should go, how it should be displayed, if an image should be centered  We express HTML elements through HTML tags  \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;     http://html.com/document/  CSS  Cascading Style Sheet  “Style sheet” code used to style the content of a web page.
