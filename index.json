This is the standard way that serious web mapping and web GIS is done. It looks great on your resume!  HTML  HyperText Markup Language  Files sent from servers to personal computers They tell the computer things like what to display or where to get data   HTML elements tell us things about where text should go, how it should be displayed, if an image should be centered  We express HTML elements through HTML tags  \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; ... \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt;     http://html.com/document/  CSS  Cascading Style Sheet  “Style sheet” code used to style the content of a web page.
